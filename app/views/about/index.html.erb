		<h3>About</h3>

		<p>ApproveForMe is a free web-based tool that simplifies your professional life by making it easier to create, track, and manage document signoffs. It works great for getting approvals from internal team members and external clients.</p>
		<p>We started ApproveForMe after dealing with frustration in our day jobs due to internal "bureaucracy." Required signoffs from management, partners, and colleagues left us wasting tons of time pinging and following up, which took time away from doing our actual work. So we decided to make ApproveForMe to handle this for us.</p>
