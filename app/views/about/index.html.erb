		<h3>About</h3>

		<p>ApproveForMe is a web-based tool that simplifies your professional life by making it easier to create, track, and manage document signoffs. It works great for getting approvals from internal team members and external clients.</p>
		<p>We started ApproveForMe after dealing with frustration in our jobs due to internal "bureaucracy." Required signoffs from management, partners, and colleagues left us wasting time pinging and following up, instead of doing our actual work. Rather than sit on the sidelines, we decided to make ApproveForMe to make it easy to create, track, and manage document signoffs.</p>
