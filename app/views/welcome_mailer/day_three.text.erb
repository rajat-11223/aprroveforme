Hi <%= @user.name %>,

We were excited to develop ApproveForMe because it solves a problem we deal with all the time in our roles. What problem you ask? Feedback!

We send emails with attachments to contacts and colleagues all the time. Sometimes to a dozen people on a project, committee, or sometimes to just a few of coworkers, and thenâ€¦ NOTHING. When we get responses, each is a separate email.

And, to make matters worse, not only do we have to monitor our inbox to see who replies (and doesn't), we have to copy their feedback into a new document so we can organize what everyone says.

ApproveForMe is the answer! With one glance, we can now see who replied and their feedback.

<% if @user.activated? %>
Make your first approval. Start working smarter! Go to your <%= dashboard_home_index_url %>.
<% else %>
Activate your account today. Start working smarter! <%= activate_account_url %>
<% end %>

If you run into any issues along the way or have any questions, feel free to reply directly to this email or visit https://www.approveforme.com and hit the blue chat icon in the corner of your screen.
