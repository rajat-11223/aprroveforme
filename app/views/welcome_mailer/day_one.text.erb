Welcome <%= @user.name %>, we’re glad you’re checking out ApproveForMe! You’re on your way to a new way of creating, tracking, and managing the things in your life that need to be approved!

Sure, you could share a Google Doc with ten contacts via Google. But when those ten people reply to you with feedback (if any do), Google will send you ten different emails. Who needs that?

Instead, share that Google Doc using ApproveForMe and we’ll organize all the feedback on one screen for you. You’ll know who said what and when they said it!

<% if @user.activated? %>
To create your first approval, please to go <%= dashboard_home_index_url %>.
<% else %>
To activate your account, please go to <%= activate_account_url %>
<% end %>

If you run into any issues along the way or have any questions, feel free to reply directly to this email or visit https://www.approveforme.com and hit the blue chat icon in the corner of your screen.
