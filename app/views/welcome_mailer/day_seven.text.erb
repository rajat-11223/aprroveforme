Hey <%= @user.name %>, it’s been a week since you created your ApproveForMe account and we noticed you haven’t created your first approval yet.

Do you think ApproveForMe is only for “formal” approvals? It’s not!

Don’t let that thinking hold you back any longer. You can use ApproveForMe for getting quick feedback on nearly anything — meeting minutes, design revisions, contract versions, agendas and event plans, group homework assignments, or whatever else you can come up with.

<% if @user.activated? %>
To create your first approval, please to go <%= dashboard_home_index_url %>.
<% else %>
To activate your account, please go to <%= activate_account_url %>.
<% end %>

If you run into any issues along the way or have any questions, feel free to reply directly to this email or visit https://www.approveforme.com and hit the blue chat icon in the corner of your screen.
