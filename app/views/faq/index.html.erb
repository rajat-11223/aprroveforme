		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<p><strong>How does ApproveForMe work if my approvers don’t use Google?</strong><br />
		If you're sending an approval to someone who doesn’t use Gmail or Google Apps, have no fear; we’ve got you covered! When you send the approval, your approver will get an email with a special link that is unique to them. When they log into ApproveForMe.com with any Google account, they’ll still be able to seemlessly view and approve for your document even though you didn’t send the approval to their Google email.</p>

		<p><strong>Can I still use ApproveForMe if my document isn’t on Google Drive?</strong><br />
		Yes! If you’re document isn’t already there, you’ll be able to easily upload it when selecting the file on the form, and we’ll automatically set the appropriate permissions so your approvers will be able to view the document.</p>

		<p><strong>What file extensions are supported?</strong><br />
		Quite a few, including Documents (Google Docs, .doc, .docs), Images (.jpeg, .png .gif, .tiff, .bmp, raw), Videos (WebM, .MPEG4, .3GPP, .MOV, .AVI, .MPEGPS, .WMV, .FLV, .ogg), Spreadsheets (Google Sheets, .xls, .xlsx), Presentations (Google Slides, .ppt, .pptx), and others like .pdf, .tiff, .svg, and .eps and Google Forms and Google Drawings. To request a file type be added, you can submit it to the feedback forum or by emailing us directly at team@approveforme.com.</p>

		<p><strong>I’d like to recommend a feature, how can I do this?</strong><br />
		First of all, you rock! You can do this by visiting the <a href="approveforme.uservoice.com" target="_blank">feedback forum</a> or by emailing us directly at team@approveforme.com.</p>

		<p><strong>How much does ApproveForMe cost?</strong><br />
		You’ll be glad to know that ApproveForMe is completely free while we’re in public beta. Stay tuned for more information on premium options.</p>
